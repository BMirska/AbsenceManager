# Before you start
You can download a ZIP file along with two CSV files ("Request" and "Absence Type"). Before using the app, you need to create a SharePoint list.

You can choose your e-mail in the EmailAdmin environmental variable, so the flow will automatically send you e-mails as new requests is sent.

How to Set Up the SharePoint List:
- Select your desired SharePoint site.
- Click "Add new list" ‚Üí "From existing CSV file".
- Choose the provided CSV file.
- This will automatically create all the necessary columns for you. It happens sometimes that automatic csv creation fails and some issues might occur.
- Now, you need to make sure to set up both lists with appropriate changes:
  "Absence Type" list should looks like this:
![AbsenceType1](https://github.com/BMirska/AbsenceManager/blob/main/SharePoint_Hint1A.jpg)

-But after import might look like this:

![AbsenceType2](https://github.com/BMirska/AbsenceManager/blob/main/SharePoint_Hint1.jpg)

  "Request" list should looks like this (most common issue is lack of ID (numeric) column. Sometimes it might be necessary to add it:
