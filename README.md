# Before you start
You can download a ZIP file along with two CSV files ("Request" and "Absence Type"). Before using the app, you need to create a SharePoint list.

You can choose your e-mail in the EmailAdmin environmental variable, so the flow will automatically send you e-mails as new requests is sent.

How to Set Up the SharePoint List:
- Select your desired SharePoint site.
- Click "Add new list" ‚Üí "From existing CSV file".
- Choose the provided CSV file.
- This will automatically create all the necessary columns for you. 
- If the automatic import fails, some columns might be missing. You will need to manually adjust:
  "Absence Type" list should looks like this:
![AbsenceType1](https://github.com/BMirska/AbsenceManager/blob/main/SharePoint_Hint1A.jpg)

-But after import might look like this:

![AbsenceType2](https://github.com/BMirska/AbsenceManager/blob/main/SharePoint_Hint1.jpg)

The "Request" list should have a numeric ID column. If missing, you must add it:
![AbsenceType2](https://github.com/BMirska/AbsenceManager/blob/main/SharePoint%20Hint2.jpg)
